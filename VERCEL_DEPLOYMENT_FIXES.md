# Fixes for Vercel Deployment Issues

## Issues Identified:
1. Admin login was redirecting to the wrong dashboard (student dashboard instead of admin dashboard)
2. CSS files were not loading properly due to incorrect path references
3. Missing logout function in dashboard.js
4. Inconsistent navigation links in HTML files

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Admin Login Redirect
- Updated index.html to redirect admin login to 'dashboard.html' instead of 'admin-dashboard.html'

### 2. Added Missing Logout Function
- Added logout() function to dashboard.js
- Added global logout() function to utils.js

### 3. Fixed CSS Path References
- Updated admin-dashboard.html to use relative paths for CSS files
- Created a root-level dashboard.html file for proper Vercel routing
- Updated all HTML files to use consistent relative paths

### 4. Fixed Navigation Links
- Updated navigation links in all admin HTML files to use relative paths:
  - students.html
  - timetable.html
  - room.html
  - staff.html
  - notifications.html

### 5. Updated Vercel Configuration
- Modified vercel.json to properly route all HTML files
