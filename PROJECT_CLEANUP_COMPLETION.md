# Project Cleanup Completion

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary
The project cleanup process has been successfully completed. Unnecessary files and folders that were not part of the main application have been removed, resulting in a cleaner and more organized project structure.

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed documentation and log files created during development
2. ✅ Removed temporary and utility files
3. ✅ Removed SQL files that should be part of the deployment structure
4. ✅ Removed other non-essential files
5. ✅ Retained all core application files and directories

## Current State
The project directory now contains only essential files needed for the application to function:
- Core application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Server files
- Configuration files
- Required directories (admin-features, user-features, etc.)
- Deployment-ready structure
- Essential documentation (README.md)

## Verification
- The main application functionality remains intact
- The deployment-ready structure is preserved
- Only necessary files are retained
- Directory structure is clean and organized

The project is now ready for deployment with a streamlined file structure.
