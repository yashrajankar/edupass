# User.html Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of [user.html](file://c:\Users\VICTUS%20User\OneDrive\Desktop\fi\deployment-ready\app\public\user.html) from the project as it was determined to be unnecessary.

## Files Removed
1. [user.html](file://c:\Users\VICTUS%20User\OneDrive\Desktop\fi\deployment-ready\app\public\user.html) - Main user landing page file

## References Updated
1. **User Dashboard Logout Link** - Updated in `user-features/dashboard/dashboard.html` and `deployment-ready/app/public/user-features/dashboard/dashboard.html`:
   - Changed from `../../user.html` to `../../index.html`

2. **Server Console Log** - Updated in `server.js` and `deployment-ready/app/server/server.js`:
   - Changed from `http://localhost:${currentPort}/user.html` to `http://localhost:${currentPort}/`

3. **Deployment Verification Script** - Updated in `deployment-ready/scripts/verify-deployment.js`:
   - Removed [user.html](file://c:\Users\VICTUS%20User\OneDrive\Desktop\fi\deployment-ready\app\public\user.html) from the expected file list

## Reasoning
The [user.html](file://c:\Users\VICTUS%20User\OneDrive\Desktop\fi\deployment-ready\app\public\user.html) file was serving as a simple landing page that redirected users to the main dashboard after 3 seconds. Since this functionality is not essential and users can directly access the dashboard, the file was deemed unnecessary for the core application functionality.

## Impact
- Simplified file structure
- Removed redundant redirect functionality
- Updated all references to point to appropriate alternatives
- No loss of core functionality

## Verification
All references to [user.html](file://c:\Users\VICTUS%20User\OneDrive\Desktop\fi\deployment-ready\app\public\user.html) have been updated, and the application should continue to function normally with users being directed to the main dashboard instead of the landing page.
