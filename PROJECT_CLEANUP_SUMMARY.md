- classroom_assignments.sql
- login_table.sql
- schema.sql
- setup.sql
- tables.sql

### Other Files (Moved to deployment structure):
- service-worker.js
- setUser.js
- test-api.js

## Files Retained (Core Project Components)
The following files and directories are essential to the main application and have been retained:

1. **Configuration Files:**
   - .env
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json

2. **Main Application Files:**
   - index.html (Main login page)
   - user.html (User dashboard)
   - admin.css (Admin styles)
   - style.css (Main styles)
   - favicon.ico
   - manifest.json
   - server.js (Main server file)
   - user.js (User interface JavaScript)
   - utils.js (Utility functions)

3. **Core Directories:**
   - admin-features/ (Admin interface components)
   - config/ (Database configuration)
   - deployment-ready/ (Deployment-ready structure)
   - import/ (Sample data files)
   - node_modules/ (Dependencies)
   - scripts/ (Utility scripts)
   - services/ (Database services)
   - templates/ (CSV templates)
   - user-features/ (User interface components)

4. **Documentation:**
   - README.md

## Verification
The project directory is now significantly cleaner with only essential files retained. The deployment-ready structure contains all necessary files organized properly for production deployment.

## Notes
- The "nul" file remains as it is a special Windows file that cannot be easily removed
- All removed files were either documentation, logs, or temporary files created during development
- Core application functionality remains intact
