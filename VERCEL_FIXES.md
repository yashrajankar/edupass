# Vercel Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the login issues and HTML display problems when hosting on Vercel.

## Issues Identified

1. **Admin Login Issue**: The admin login form was using hardcoded credentials instead of calling the API
2. **User Login Issue**: User login was not working properly on Vercel due to API endpoint configuration
3. **HTML Display Issue**: After login, only HTML was shown without proper styling or functionality
4. **Path Issues**: Incorrect path references causing CSS and JS files not to load properly

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Admin Login Form (index.html)
- Replaced hardcoded admin login check with proper API call to `/api/auth/admin/login`
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Ensured redirect to `admin-dashboard.html` after successful login

### 2. Updated API Configuration (config.js)
- Improved environment detection to properly identify Vercel deployments
- Added logging for debugging purposes
- Added health check function for testing API connectivity

### 3. Fixed Routing Configuration (vercel.json)
- Added API proxy routes to forward API requests to the backend service
- Ensured all HTML files are properly routed
- Added proper handling for API endpoints

### 4. Enhanced Utility Functions (utils.js)
- Improved API endpoint detection for Vercel environments
- Added better error handling for fetch operations
- Enhanced logout function to clear all user data

### 5. Added Debugging Tools
- Created debug.html for diagnosing environment and API issues
- Added console logging for environment detection
- Created test-api.html for testing API connectivity

## How to Deploy

1. Ensure your backend API is deployed and accessible (currently configured to use https://edupass-backend.onrender.com)
2. Update the production API URL in config.js if you're using a different backend
3. Deploy to Vercel using `vercel` command or through GitHub integration

## Testing

1. Visit the debug.html page to verify environment detection and API configuration
2. Test both admin and user login functionality
3. Verify that dashboards load properly after login
4. Check that all navigation links work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the backend API is accessible
3. Ensure the API URL in config.js is correct for your deployment
4. Check that all required environment variables are set
